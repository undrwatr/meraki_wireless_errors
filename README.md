This program is my first attempt at using Flask to provide a gui for a python program. It was adapted from some examples from here: https://github.com/nathanwiens/meraki-add-device-webapp. This provided me with needed basis to start putting my programs into a web app that could be called from a web page rather than how I have been doing it with ssh scripts and a bash menu. I am going to start moving the rest of my programs into this, but this was my first attempt.
